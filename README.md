# Game-development-
A functioning Brick breaker with a designed brick pattern.
Ball auto resets and game can be restarted.

If i were to continue with this project i would add a scoring system alongside adding lives so the whole board resets if you run out of lives 

When used on touch devices a set of arrow keys appears so they can be used to control the paddle
