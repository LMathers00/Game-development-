# Game-development-
Brick-Breaker?? style game 
<!-- Psuedo code -->

<!-- essentials -->
Solid colour background

A menu with a 'play button' and a 'how to play button'
'play button' should launch us into the game 
'how to play' should contain brief description of how the game works and any other essential information 
These should all be acessible using keyboard only 

For the 'game' we require
A multitude of 'bricks' that disappear when hit (maybe with sound effect??)
moving ball which stays at a constant speed and bounces accordingly 
a paddle which the ball bounces off of which is user controlled using arrow keys or wasd

a few different level designs 
if all levels are complete it should display a 'You win' screen with a button back to the main menu - maybe include the confetti cannon etc

A number of lives 
When lives run out it should display a 'You lose' screen and should also contain a button back to the main menu 

<!-- Bounce physics  -->
Angle of incidence = angle of reflection 
not just as simple as a 90 degree bounce 

<!-- Plan -->
start with the basic screens and the buttons which help us navigate
